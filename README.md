1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was the client in this project, and wanted a cross-platform game to be easily expandable in the event of more players.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I was able to weigh the pros and cons of different opperating systems pretty accuratly, allowing for cost effictive practices.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document kept me on track, and helped increase overall productivity. It also helped reduce the amout in a backlog.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably revise the conclusion of the design document, since it felt rushed. I would spend a bit more time wording the document.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to implement the user's needs everywhere I could. Whenever the cost became to great to add their needs, I would attempt to add the next best thing.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would follow this design document pretty closely if I had similar problems in the future. It seemed to be a pretty accurate template, and provide insight into the future.
